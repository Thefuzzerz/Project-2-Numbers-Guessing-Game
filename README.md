# Project-2---Build-a-Soccer-League

This code was created for the second project in Treehouse's Python techdegree program.

The purpose of the code is to take in a csv of soccer players and place them into teams. 

These teams are split evenly, taking into consideration the players experience. 

These experienced players are distributed evenly between teams.

Letters to each parent (retrieved from the csv) are then populated along with an overall team roster.

The letters contain the child's team, team members, and first practice date.
