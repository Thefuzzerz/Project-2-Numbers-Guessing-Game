Dear Hyman and Rachel Krustofski,

Your child Herschel has been selected to play for the Raptors this season!

Herschel will be joined by the following members on their team:

***** Raptors 2018 Roster *****
Bill Bon
Suzane Greenberg
Kimmy Stein
Ben Finkelstein
Arnold Willis

We encourage guardians to carpool to help reduce congestion, pollution, and crowding in the parking structure.
This is also a fantastic opportunity for the children to socialize with each other.

The Raptors' first practice will be held on July 14th, 2018

We look forward to seeing you there!!!

Sincerely,
Treehouse Soccer Management
