Dear Heather Bledsoe,

Your child Karl has been selected to play for the Sharks this season!

Karl will be joined by the following members on their team:

***** Sharks 2018 Roster *****
Jill Tanner
Les Clay
Matt Gill
Joe Kavalier
Chloe Alaska

We encourage guardians to carpool to help reduce congestion, pollution, and crowding in the parking structure.
This is also a fantastic opportunity for the children to socialize with each other.

The Sharks' first practice will be held on July 12th, 2018

We look forward to seeing you there!!!

Sincerely,
Treehouse Soccer Management
