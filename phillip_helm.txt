Dear Thomas Helm and Eva Jones,

Your child Phillip has been selected to play for the Dragons this season!

Phillip will be joined by the following members on their team:

***** Dragons 2018 Roster *****
Joe Smith
Diego Soto
Eva Gordon
Sammy Adams
Sal Dali

We encourage guardians to carpool to help reduce congestion, pollution, and crowding in the parking structure.
This is also a fantastic opportunity for the children to socialize with each other.

The Dragons' first practice will be held on July 10th, 2018

We look forward to seeing you there!!!

Sincerely,
Treehouse Soccer Management
